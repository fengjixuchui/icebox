# This kernel module can be automatically loaded by non-root users.
# To enhance system security, the module is blacklisted by default.
# System administrators can make the module available for use only if
# required.
# We use /bin/true so existing code expecting a successful module
# load during installation will not bail out with an (false) error.
# Remove blacklisting by adding a comment # at the start of the lines.
blacklist vboxpci
install vboxpci /bin/true
